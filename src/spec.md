# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Simplify the interactive surprises hub to only Gallery and Gift, and present the love-letter message inside the Gift modal with romantic, letter-style typography.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the “For You”/Letter card from the InteractivePage so only “Gallery” and “A Gift for You” are selectable, and adjust the layout for two cards.
- Remove any imports/usages that open the Letter modal from the interactive hub.
- Move the existing Letter modal message content into the Gift modal, replacing the current gift/rose-meaning text while keeping the roses bouquet image visible.
- Update Gift modal text styling to a romantic, letter-like structure (greeting/body/sign-off) with consistent romantic typography.

**User-visible outcome:** The hub shows only Gallery and Gift; opening Gift displays the love-letter message in a romantic, structured letter format alongside the roses bouquet, and the Letter experience is no longer accessible.
